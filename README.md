# THEO 32 - THEOX
THEO 32 is a custom CPU architecture.

# Introduction
The goal of this project is to learn about the limitations of CPU made of transistors that can be seen by the human eye (SOT32 2,5x1mm), as well as getting a deeper understanding of computer logic and programming on the hardware level.

## About the creator
Hi, I'm Mathijs Klaver. A 13 year old from the Netherlands who's intresseted in electronics and computer logic / programming. 

I have no prior experience with designing a computer architecture, nor did I have anyone who could help me design it. I have tried designing computers when i was younger. When I was around 7 I tried designing my first computer in minecraft (Which i faild at). But still, this experience gave me a lot of knowledge. But now I have experience in working with electronics and computers (Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry pi), so I tried again.

# Additional
## Compiler
I've created a compiler to compile my custom language 'THASM' into machine language THEO 32 can understand. (The documentation on the language is not fully done yet) https://github.com/MathijssYDev/THASM

## Whitepaper
Their is a whitepaper available for this project which contains more a more detailed explaination about the CPU and its workings.
