# THEO 32 - THEOX

THEO 32 is a custom CPU architecture.

# Introduction

The goal of this project is to learn about the limitations of a CPU made of transistors that can be seen by the human eye (SOT32 2.5x1mm), as well as getting a deeper understanding of computer logic and programming at the hardware level.

## About the creator

Hi, I'm Mathijs Klaver, a 13-year-old from the Netherlands who's interested in electronics and computer logic/programming.

I have no prior experience with designing a computer architecture, nor did I have anyone who could help me design it. I have tried designing computers when I was younger. When I was around 7, I tried designing my first computer in Minecraft (which I failed at). But still, this experience gave me a lot of knowledge. But now I have experience working with electronics and computers (Arduino, ESP32, Raspberry Pi), so I tried again.

# Compiler

I've created a compiler to compile my custom language "THASM" into machine language that THEO 32 can understand. (The documentation on the language is not fully done yet.) https://github.com/MathijssYDev/THASM

# Emulator

The CPU design is fully created within a digital logic designer called Digital. All the files within the Architecture Design folder can be read by this program. Using THASM, the CPU can be easily programmed.

## Whitepaper

There is a whitepaper available for this project, which contains a more detailed explanation of the CPU and its workings.

# Disclaimer

This CPU design is not yet finished, so there may be missing information.
